This was a class project designed to teach us the basics of C and C++. With this, we covered the idea of classes, and how to create a good make file for testing.
Throughout this project, we practiced the idea of revising our code starting with structs in the beginning and slowly transitioning to objects in C++.

The project first started with us coding everything using Vim and then as the project grew in complexity we transitioned to CLion. At the end of the project we
documented all our code using Doxygen and posted it online through the school system.
